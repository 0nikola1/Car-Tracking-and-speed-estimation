# Vehicle detection and tracking module
Vehicle tracking implemented with YOLOv4, DeepSort, and TensorFlow. YOLOv4 is a state of the art algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detections. We can take the output of YOLOv4 feed these object detections into Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) in order to create a highly accurate object tracker.

## Running the Module
Install all the dependencies and create conda environment to run the model.

### Conda 

```bash
# Tensorflow GPU
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
conda activate yolov4-g
```

### Download the pretrained weights for YOLOv4

Our object tracker uses YOLOv4 to make the object detections, which deep sort then uses to track. There exists an official pre-trained YOLOv4 object detector model that is able to detect 80 classes. For easy demo purposes we will use the pre-trained weights for our tracker.
Download pre-trained yolov4.weights file: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cewMfusmPjYWbrnuJRuKhPMwRe_b9PaT

Copy and paste yolov4.weights from your downloads folder into the 'data' folder of this repository.

If you want to use yolov4-tiny.weights, a smaller model that is faster at running detections but less accurate, download file here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.weights

### Executing the module

To implement the object tracking using YOLOv4, first we convert the .weights into the corresponding TensorFlow model which will be saved to a checkpoints folder. Then all we need to do is run the object_tracker.py script to run our object tracker with YOLOv4, DeepSort and TensorFlow.
```bash
# Convert darknet weights to tensorflow model
python save_model.py --model yolov4 

# Run yolov4 deep sort object tracker on video
python object_tracker.py --video ./data/video/test.mp4 --output ./outputs/demo.avi --model yolov4
```
